# React Boilerplate

This boilerplate provides a minimal setup to get React working.

Currently, this bolierplate includes React + Javascript + Vite + SWC + Tailwind CSS + Storybook.

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the project for production using Vite.
- `npm run preview`: Starts a local server to preview the production build of the project.
- `npm run storybook`: Starts the Storybook development server on port 6006.
- `npm run build-storybook`: Builds the project's Storybook.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint on the project's JavaScript and JSX files, reporting any unused disable directives and failing if there are any warnings.
